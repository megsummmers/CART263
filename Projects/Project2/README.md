Artist Statement:

Welcome to my murder mystery game! In this game you follow the murder of Nicolas Harper, a wealthy businessman who was a treasure hunter on the side.
Last night he was murdered in his own treasure room and its up to you to find out who did it! Was it his jealous brother, overworked assistant or
his desperate wife? You'll have to find out by playing some short games to uncover clues and find the murder weapon. You'll also be in charge of
speaking with the 3 suspects to try and find the guilty party by the end of your investigation!

I have always been a fan of a good murder mystery and its always been a dream of mine to make one myself, so this is my first attempt at that!
I am very proud of the results, although I do see many ways I could have done better. I wasn't able to add everything mechanic or even
creatively push the minigames as far as I wanted but I still think the game looks good from an outside perspective. This game is
supposed to be a fun time to use your brain and solve the simple murder myster. I wasn't going for a suspensful or scary msytery game, I was more going for
bright and funny spin on a classic murder mystery. My hope is that the user gets insterested in the story and the characters involved while they
play all the short minigames and try to piece together the story.
